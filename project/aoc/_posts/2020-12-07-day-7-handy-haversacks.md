*<span class="text-warning">The seventh day was quite busy for me, so I was not able to finish the puzzle. I will revisit this later when I have some more time.</span>*

The day 7 input consisted of a series of rules. Each rule specifies what coloured bag should contain a certain number of other coloured bag(s). For example: `light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.`
