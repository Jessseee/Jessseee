                Lately I felt inspired by the limitations of the 8-bit fantasy console PICO-8. Made by <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/">Lexaloffle Games</a> this small arcade machine that never existed brings out a type of nostalgia and boosts creativity with its limited specs.

                One of the reasons I stumbled upon this fun engine is because of the awesome game <a href="http://www.celestegame.com/">Celeste</a>. The game was originally developed using PICO-8 and later remade in a more capable game engine to be released on consoles and PC. The original PICO-8 game can still be played on an old pc hidden in the game's levels.
