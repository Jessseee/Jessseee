        <p>Fish Out of Water is an interactive VR experience visualizing global water pollution data. It visualizes this data by the amount of pollution in a lake, each object represents an amount of pollution of that category. We aim to raise awareness about water pollution and the dangers it poses to our living environment.</p>
        <p>The goal of the project was to physicalize data in a virtual reality environment. We worked with a team of 10 people, where I lead the VR team. I created all pointer interactions, made sure that the design was consistent and created some of the assets.</p>

        <h4>Interactions</h4>
        <p>The project is playable on Oculus Go and Gear VR. The player can interact with the environment using the pointer to teleport around the campsite. To filter the data the player can interact with the information board near the edge of the water. When the player changes the year using the calendar, the radio will play a news snippet about environmental disasters which happened that year.</p>
        <h4>Development</h4>
        <p>The project is developed for the Oculus Go and Gear VR. The project is made in Unity with the Oculus Integration plugin to work with the Oculus Go and Gear VR. Using OVRInput, I created multiple possible interactions with the VR environment. Interactions such as teleporting, rotating, interacting and grabbing. Next to that FMOD is used for sound design to create a more immersive VR experience.</p>
