title: Garden of 3D3N

## Introduction
Garden of 3D3N is an interactive installation I made as a group project for the 2018 edition of the [GOGBOT](https://2018.gogbot.nl) art and technology festival. In this interactive installation we wanted to let the user experience creating new live through genetic manipulation. The setup consists of both a Virtual Reality (VR) experience and an audiovisual installations where other people can interact without putting on a VR headset. In the VR environment, new life is created. While in the VR simulation, a creature is formed in front of you when you grab DNA fragments and connect them together. Once the creature is done it will be put on display. Other users can then vote if the creature is allowed to walk into the Garden of 3D3N or if it will be destroyed!

## Experience

### Virtual Reality
Different limbs or other body parts are added to the users creature as they collect more DNA-fragments. Once the creature is complete, which the user has to decide for themselves, other people will vote whether the creature lives or dies. If it dies, the creature shall cease to exist, but if it lives, it will be placed in the Garden of 3D3N. The Garden is our new world, a lush, green, beautiful place, where our new creatures roam freely and happily.

### Physical
To allow people passing by the interactive installation to not feel locked out for not trying the VR experience we also added physical interactions. When a creature is created by a user in VR it is put on display where other people can vote on whether the creature can continue into the Garden of 3D3N by pressing one of two physical buttons. If the creature is voted out the user will see it being destroyed on the display. If the creature is voted into the garden it will be beamed off-screen and will appear on the other screen where the Garden of 3D3N is displayed.

### Flow-map
Before creating Garden of 3D3N we thought out the complete experience we want people to have when interacting with our installation. We made a concise flow-map that describes what we expect people to experience when interacting with the different parts of our installation.
